### Lab12

<!-- 
Your README should be in introduction to your web app. Provide in your README, your ERD Diagram and an overview of the relationships and how each entity is related to another. -->


### Introduction

* We create a web app that holds Hotel, Room & Amenity models.
* We added controllers so we can navigate to each model using the following routes:
	- ../Api/Hotels --> Access all the Hotels data.
	- ../Api/Rooms --> Access all the Rooms data.
	- ../Api/Amenities --> Acess all the Amenities data.
	
* We populated our tables with existing data using seeding, that's why you will be able to see some data at the routes mentioned before.
